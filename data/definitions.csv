Abandoned wood-pastures in the uplands are remnants of a lost land-use system, which is still extant in many parts of continental Europe.

Changes to the hydrological management of upland habitats can be detrimental to the characteristic vegetation and,,,Sluices.

It is the only native animal that merits the term ‘habitat architect’ at the scale used in habitat classification and mapping. Beavers offer a nature-based solution to improving the health and function of river catchments. Beaver-created wetlands can act as sponges, resulting in more constant flows and retaining water during droughts. A series of leaky beaver dams can reduce the speed of flow and help reduce the chance of flash flooding. Beaver dams can capture organic sediments, reducing the effects of agricultural runoff and harmful chemicals such as pesticides, helping to improve water quality downstream.",,"Wetlands, standing water, running water and woodlands where the habitat has been created or significantly modified by Beaver activity.",Other areas of habitat that may be used by Beaver but the habitat is not significantly modified by the activities of the,.,

Fens are peatlands which receive water and nutrients from groundwater and surface run-off, as well as from rainfall. Flushes are associated with lateral water movement, and springs with localised upwelling of water. Marsh is a general term usually used to imply waterlogged soil; it is used more specifically here to refer to fen meadows and rush- pasture communities on mineral soils and shallow peats. Swamps are characterised by tall emergent vegetation.

Topogenous fens are those where water movements in the peat or soil are generally vertical. They include basin fens, fens of lake margins, some forms of floodplain fen and the lagg fens of raised bogs. Soligenous fens, on the other hand, develop where there is distinct water movement through the system, so such movements are predominantly lateral, rather than vertical, and include valley mires, springs and flushes. Rich fens are associated with water derived from base-rich rocks such as chalk and other limestones and as such are generally confined to the lowlands.

s2a5,Vegetated sea cliffs,Vegetated sea cliffs are steep slopes fringing hard or soft coasts. They were created by past or present marine erosion and support a wide diversity of vegetation types with variable maritime influence.,"Exposure to the sea is a key determinant of sea cliff vegetation type. In the UK, exposure is greatest on the southwest and northern coasts. The long fetch associated with these coasts generates high waves and swell, and the prevailing winds help deliver salt spray to the cliff face and clifftops. However, the degree to which this affects the salinity of clifftop vegetation also depends on the amount of rainfall, with high rainfall areas, such as northwest Scotland, being less saline or maritime than drier areas, such as southeast England. Exposure is another important factor. The most exposed areas support maritime vegetation dominated by a range of salt-tolerant plants. More sheltered cliffs support communities closely related to those found on similar substrates inland, such as grassland and heath, with only a minor maritime element in the flora.

Reefs form on a variety of hard substrata, from pebbles to bedrock, in areas with a good supply of suspended sand grains, from which the animals form their tubes. They include areas of sediment when an attachment has been established. The Honeycomb Worm Sabellaria alveolata larvae are strongly stimulated to settle by the presence of existing colonies or their dead remains.

The presence of boulders on a shore may also lead to local modification to wave exposure, current strength and levels of trapped organic matter in the surrounding area. Altering the physical environment in this way results in an enhancement to the immediate biodiversity beyond the boulders themselves. This habitat can occur on a variety of substrata (including bedrock, mixed rock, and sediment or mud), but there needs to be a sufficient gap on the underside of the boulder to support an underboulder community. The richest underboulder communities are often found where there is running seawater (for instance, from pools or lagoons emptying after the tide has fallen).",,,"Boulders with a limited underboulder community (as may occur, for example, where boulders are embedded in sediment, in low salinity conditions, or where boulders experience high levels of mobility and scour).",,

Beaches, which tend to be composed of sandier material, develop in more exposed situations and are also widely distributed.
